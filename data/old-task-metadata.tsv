X179	VITAMIN & COFACTOR METABOLISM	FOLATE METABOLISM	Tetrahydrofolate synthesis	iHSA (117)/recon2 (337)	The synthesis of folate starts with a two step conversion of GTP to dihydroneopterin-P3 by GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH I). C-8 of GTP is released as formate. The enzyme, in contrast to GTPCH II (riboflavin synthesis), incorporates C atoms of ribose into the pteridine ring system. Dihydroneopterin-P3 is also an intermediate of the pathways leading to biopterin (3.7.6.3) and to methanopterin. The specific part of the tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis proceeds via a (so far unspecified) removal of all phosphates, side chain shortening and pyrophosphorylation to 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-hydroxymethyl- 7,8-dihydropteridine-P2. The fusion of this intermediate with 4-aminobenzoate to 7,8-dihydropteroate is the target of the antibacterial action of sulfonamides. After the ATP dependent addition of glutamate, the resulting dihydrofolate is reduced to tetrahydro folate. In eukarya, the synthesis is performed in mitochondria.

X62	AMINO ACIDS METABOLISM	ALANINE METABOLISM	Alanine degradation	iHSA (77)/recon2 (42)	Alanine plays a key role in glucose–alanine cycle between tissues and liver. In muscle and other tissues that degrade amino acids for fuel, amino groups are collected in the form of glutamate by transamination. Glutamate can then transfer its amino group through the action of alanine aminotransferase to pyruvate, a product of muscle glycolysis, forming alanine and α-ketoglutarate. The alanine formed is passed into the blood and transported to the liver. A reverse of the alanine aminotransferase reaction takes place in liver. Pyruvate regenerated forms glucose through gluconeogenesis, which returns to muscle through the circulation system. Glutamate in the liver enters mitochondria and degrades into ammonium ion through the action of glutamate dehydrogenase, which in turn participate in the urea cycle to form urea	PAGE 59-60

The most relevant glutamine-producing tissue is the muscle mass, accounting for about 90% of all glutamine synthesized. Glutamine is also released, in small amounts, by the lungs and brain.[11] Although the liver is capable of relevant glutamine synthesis, its role in glutamine metabolism is more regulatory than producing, since the liver takes up large amounts of glutamine derived from the gut	PAGE 60	HEX1 (atp[c] + glc_D[c] -> adp[c] + g6p[c] + h[c] ) - PGI (g6p[c] <=> f6p[c] ) - PFK (atp[c] + f6p[c] -> adp[c] + fdp[c] + h[c] ) - FBA (fdp[c] <=> dhap[c] + g3p[c] ) - TPI (dhap[c] <=> g3p[c] ) - GAPD (g3p[c] + nad[c] + pi[c] <=> 13dpg[c] + h[c] + nadh[c] ) - PGK (3pg[c] + atp[c] <=> 13dpg[c] + adp[c] ) - PGM (2pg[c] <=> 3pg[c] ) - ENO (2pg[c] <=> h2o[c] + pep[c] ) - PYK (adp[c] + h[c] + pep[c] -> atp[c] + pyr[c] ) - PDHm (coa[m] + nad[m] + pyr[m] -> accoa[m] + co2[m] + nadh[m] ) - PCm (atp[m] + hco3[m] + pyr[m] -> adp[m] + h[m] + oaa[m] + pi[m] ) - CSm (accoa[m] + h2o[m] + oaa[m] -> cit[m] + coa[m] + h[m] ACONTm (cit[m] <=> icit[m] ) - ICDHxm (icit[m] + nad[m] -> akg[m] + co2[m] + nadh[m] ) - GLUDxm (glu-L[m] + h2o[m] + nad[m] <=> akg[m] + h[m] + nadh[m] + nh4[m] ) - GLNS (atp[c] + glu_L[c] + nh4[c] -> adp[c] + gln_L[c] + h[c] + pi[c])

The amino group of glutamine can be transferred by transaminase reactions (3.2.2.5) to other moieties for synthesis of amino acids (3.2.2 … 3.2.9), amino sugars (3.1.7.1), nucleotides (3.6.1, 3.6.2), NAD (3.7.9.1) etc.	PAGE 60	
X92	AMINO ACIDS METABOLISM	GLUTAMINE METABOLISM	Glutaminolysis (glutamine to lactate)	iHSA (267)/recon2 (291)	Glutaminolysis is a series of biochemical reactions by which the amino acid glutamine is lysed to glutamate, aspartate, CO2, pyruvate, lactate, alanine and citrate.Glutaminolysis is an important energy source in tumor cells. Glutamine is converted to gutamate (glutaminase) and further converted in alpha-ketoglutarate (glutamate deshydrogenase) to enter in the TCA cycle and malate-aspartate shuttle. The formed malate is then converted in pyruvate and further in lactate -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutaminolysis		GLUNm (glutaminase (mitochondrial) - gln-L + h2o --> glu-L + nh4) - GLUDxm (glutamate dehydrogenase (NAD) (mitochondrial) - glu-L + h2o + nad <==> akg + h + nadh + nh4) - AKGDm (2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase - akg + coa + nad --> co2 + nadh + succoa) - SUCOASm (Succinate--CoA ligase (ADP-forming) - atp + coa + succ <==> adp + pi + succoa) - SUCD1m (succinate dehydrogenase - fad + succ <==> fadh2 + fum) - FUMm (fumarase, mitochondrial - fum + h2o <==> mal-L) - ME1m (malic enzyme (NAD), mitochondrial - mal-L + nad --> co2 + nadh + pyr) -LDH_Lm (L-lactate dehydrogenase - h + nadh + pyr <==> lac-L + nad)

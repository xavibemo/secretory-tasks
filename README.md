# Curation of Secretory Tasks

A repository dedicated to curate and incorporate genome-scale reconstructions of secretory pathways from [Gutierrez et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13867-y) as Secretory Tasks. Secretory Tasks were incorporated to the latest version of the Human-GEM metabolic model ([Robinson et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1126/scisignal.aaz1482)).
